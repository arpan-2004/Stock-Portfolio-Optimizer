# Stock-Portfolio-Optimizer
The Stock Market Portfolio Optimizer is a machine learning and data-driven project designed to help investors create an optimal stock portfolio based on risk and return preferences. By leveraging historical market data and mathematical optimization techniques, the tool assists users in making data-informed investment decisions.

This project uses Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) developed by Harry Markowitz, which emphasizes diversification to achieve the best possible return for a given level of risk. The optimizer calculates expected returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and generates a range of portfolios to identify the most efficient frontier.

 Core Concepts:
Expected Return: Estimated average return of the portfolio

Volatility (Risk): Standard deviation of returns

Sharpe Ratio: Risk-adjusted return metric

Efficient Frontier: Set of optimal portfolios offering the highest return for a defined level of risk

 Features:
Fetches historical stock data using APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance)

Performs portfolio simulations using Monte Carlo methods

Visualizes optimal portfolios and the efficient frontier using Matplotlib or Plotly

Allows users to input their own list of stock tickers and investment preferences

Outputs allocation suggestions for maximum Sharpe ratio, minimum volatility, or target return
